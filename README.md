PhoenixCraft
============
- When you are updating the PhoenixCraftModpack, be sure to note ALL your changes in the changelog file above the README file
- The PhoenixCraftModpack folder will be the official folder that I will zip-up and use to submit/update the modpack with FTB.
- Anything that needs to be on this github, but is not in the PCM folder, must be put in this folder, because I must follow certain indexing rules!


How-to Install

1. Install MinecraftForge on your VANILLA launcher (Use the forge version specified in "info.txt" file, located in the "PhoenixCraftModpack" folder)
2. Clone PhoenixCraft onto your desktop
3. Create a new instance (using specified forge version, on vanilla launcher) using C:\-Wherever\PhoenixCraft\PhoenixCraftModpack\minecraft as root directory
4. To Be discussed (Weather to upload mods to github or not, my guess is No)
